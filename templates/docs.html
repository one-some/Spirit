<h3>Adding Students</h3>
<div id="docs-adding-students">
    Spirit allows for two ways of importing students through the user interface.<br>
    The <a element="#add-student">Add Student button</a> lets you add students one at a time through the right-hand
    information panel.<br>
    Its neighboring button, the <a element="#batch-add-button">Batch Add button</a>, allows you to batch-import students
    by means of uploading a CSV file.
